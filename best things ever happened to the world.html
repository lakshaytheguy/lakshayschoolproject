            <p>HTML 5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard. It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers etc. HTML 5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also X HTML 1 and D O M Level 2 HTML. HTML 5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces Is for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML 5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.</div>

        <font size="5" color="black"> The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,[8] and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.[9] W3C and WHATWG are currently working together on the development of HTML5.[9] The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop in June 2004,[10] focusing on developing technologies that are backward compatible with existing browsers,[11] including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML.[12] Immediately after the workshop, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced.[13] The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5.[14] The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007. WHATWG published the First Public Working Draft of the specification on 22 January 2008.[15]
